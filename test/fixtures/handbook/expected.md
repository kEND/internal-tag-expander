## E.3 GIFT ACCEPTANCE POLICY ##


### Gift Acceptance Policy (GAP)

##### Introduction:

* International Friendships Inc is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) 
of the Internal Revenue Code (Tax ID number is 31- 0971249). 
We are also classified as a public charity under Section 509(a)(2) 
of the Code. IFI is eligible to receive contributions deductible 
as charitable donations for federal in come tax purposes. We 
are qualified to receive tax deductible bequests, devises, 
transfers, or gifts under Section 2055, 2106, or 2522 of the Code. 

* IFI staff is authorized to receive, hold, invest and administer 
property, and to make expenditures, as directed and monitored 
by IFI Board of Directors, to or for the exclusive benefit of IFI. 

* IFI maintains the highest standards of financial integrity
in all our business dealings. IFI is a member of the Evangelical 
Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA). The ECFA is 
an accreditation agency for leading Christian non-profit organizations 
that faithfully demonstrate compliance with established 
standards for financial accountability, fundraising, and board 
governance. 

* IFI practices the highest ethical standards 
of financial accountability and reporting consistent
with responsible Christian faith and practice.  An independent 
audit of our financial records is conducted annually by a Certified 
Public Accounting firm.  A Form 990 tax return is filed annually 
for IFI.  The recent years audited financial statements and 
tax returns can be viewed on the IFI website or by request. 

* According to IRS guidelines, IFI must maintain sole control 
and discretion over the use of the funds once a tax-deductible 
receipt is issued. Tax deductible gifts are non-refundable. 
In the event that changes occur in IFI staff, ministries 
or projects, all tax-deductible gifts remain non-refundable.

#### ARTICLE I Acceptance of Gifts 


##### Section 1.1 Encouraging Gifts.  

IFI encourages private support through gifts of any amount in the form of
cash, stock, real estate, personal property or other assets, including
gifts through trusts, estates or insurance policies.

The committee with responsibility to review potential planned gifts will be
called the Gift Review Committee.

The Gift Review Committee will assess compliance as outlined in the
Board-approved policy.  The Executive Director shall appoint three or more
members, to include representation from IFI’s Departments of Development and
Finance, and may seek outside advisement as needed.

##### Section 1.2 Declining Gifts.  

IFI may decline any gift that in its judgment creates unacceptable
challenges, undue expense, or a perception of impropriety or conflicts with
the organization’s mission. 


##### Section 1.3 Costs of Gifts.  

IFI will not accept gifts that may result in expenses and or fees that will
be incurred by IFI.  However, IFI will clarify with a donor under what
circumstances, if any, IFI will pay for legal fees or professional fees
with respect to completing a gift.  IFI may also choose to pay for
appraisals for its own purposes.  If IFI pays for a gift cost that is the
legal obligation of the donor, the value of the gift will be reduced by the
cost to IFI for the services, or alternatively, the gift may be treated as
a bargain sale for tax purposes with the cost to IFI as the compensation to
the donor.  

#### ARTICLE II Types of Gifts   


##### Section 2.1 Cash and Marketable Securities.  

IFI will accept outright gifts of cash and marketable securities. Normally,
it will be the goal of IFI to sell any contributed marketable securities
for the full fair market value as soon as possible after receipt.   


##### Section 2.2. Tangible Personal Property.  

IFI may accept gifts of tangible personal property after considering the
marketability of such property, the costs of owning and maintaining the
property, any restrictions on the use of the property and whether the
property is directly related to IFI’s mission.  IFI’s acceptance of
tangible personal property does not guarantee its retention as IFI property
in perpetuity.   


##### Section 2.3 Bequests and Beneficiary Designations.    

IFI will encourage donors to name IFI in the donor’s will or trust or as
the beneficiary of the donor’s life insurance or retirement plan.  IFI will
provide any such donors with appropriate language to name IFI as a
beneficiary and encourage such donors to work with IFI in planning gifts
for special purposes. 


##### Section 2.4 Other Gifts.  

Other gifts may be accepted by IFI upon the approval of the Gift Review
Committee.  In determining whether to accept a gift, the Gift Review Committee 
shall consider the factors outlined below and, ultimately, whether acceptance 
of the gift is in the best interests of IFI. 
 

1. Closely Held Business Interests.  IFI may accept gifts of closely held
   business interests after considering the marketability of such property,
   liability risks associated with such interests, potential adverse tax
   consequences to IFI and any restrictions on the transfer of interests.

2. Real Property.  Normally, it will be the goal of IFI to sell any
   contributed real estate for its full fair market value as soon as
   possible after receipt.  Therefore, each proposed gift of real estate
   will be reviewed by legal or outside counsel partly to determine the
   conditions under which it can be sold.  However, IFI may receive real
   estate with the view to hold and use it directly in the IFI operations
   or otherwise to carry-out the organization’s exempt purposes.  Because
   of the time and resources involved in reviewing any gift of real estate,
   IFI prefers that any proposed gift of real estate involve $100,000 or
   more of equity. The following guidelines will be used in the review of
   gifts of real estate.  IFI requests that:

    1. The donor will provide the location, or a plot map, of the property
       so that a visual inspection of the site can be made.  

    2. The donor will provide copies of all leases, mortgages and other
       contracts affecting the property.  

    3. The Gift Review Committee will determine if it is advisable to obtain
       an Environmental Assessment so that IFI can be assured that the
       property is free of contamination and environmental hazards.  The
       donor will contract and pay for a Phase I Environmental Assessment
       of the property if the Gift Review Committee requests an assessment.
       If the Phase I Environmental Assessment indicates that environmental
       problems exist, an additional assessment or remediation may be
       required.  

    4. The tax law requires that the donor obtain a "qualified appraisal"
       of the property in order to claim a charitable income tax deduction
       on the donor's tax return for the year of the gift.  The very
       specific requirements for a qualified appraisal can be found in the
       IRS regulations, or in IRS Publication 561, Determining the Value of
       Donated Property.  The donor, IFI, and the appraiser all must sign
       the IRS Form 8283, which must be filed with the donor’s tax return.  

    5. The donor will provide evidence of clear title to the property
       through a title insurance policy.  

    6. The donor may need to sign an Indemnity Agreement to provide
       protection for IFI’s other assets.  The need for this agreement
       arises from the fact that there may be expenses that will require a
       cash outlay on the part of IFI between the time the property is
       contributed and eventually sold, and a donor’s fund might not have
       enough liquid assets to allow IFI to cover these expenses.  These
       expenses could include such items as taxes, insurance, maintenance,
       condominium charges, etc.  In some instances, IFI may agree to use
       the proceeds from the sale of the property to cover IFI’s expenses
       with respect to the property.  

    7. The donor will sign a recordable General Warranty Deed conveying the
       property to IFI.  The donor may also be asked to provide an
       Exemption from Real Property Conveyance Fee Form, so that the
       Warranty Deed can be filed with the Auditor’s Office and Recorder’s
       Office of the county in which the property is located. 

3. Life Insurance.  IFI may accept gifts of life insurance policies.  There
   are many methods by which life insurance may be donated to IFI and each
   method requires a thorough evaluation of the policy, insurance company
   and benefits to IFI.  IFI generally will accept donations of paid-up
   policies.  IFI may accept gifts of life insurance that require IFI to
   pay the premium if the donor pledges to continue paying premiums or
   gives IFI permission to surrender the policy for cash value.  IFI shall
   not accept gifts of life insurance where (i) there is a prearranged
   obligation for IFI to expend its assets to maintain the policy, (ii) any
   portion of the proceeds is paid to anyone or any organization that is
   not an organization described in Internal Revenue Code Section
   501(c)(3), or (iii) the policy is a split dollar or reverse split dollar
   plan.  All policies contributed to IFI must name IFI as the owner and
   irrevocable beneficiary of the policy.

4. Retirement Plans.  IFI may accept gifts from retirement plans which
   includes, but is not limited to, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs),
   401(k) and 403(b) plans, or other qualified or nonqualified plans.
   Before accepting the gift, IFI will require a thorough evaluation of the
   retirement plan.  All retirements plans contributed to IFI must name IFI
   as the primary, successor or contingent beneficiary for all or a
   percentage of the assets upon the death of the donor as owner or upon
   death of the owner’s spouse, if applicable.  Such beneficiary
   designation must be on the form prescribed by the trustee or
   administrator of the retirement account and properly filed with the
   same.

5. Charitable Gift Annuities.  IFI may offer charitable gift annuities to
   qualified donors.  As a general rule, IFI will utilize the services of a
   community foundation’s (such as The Columbus Foundation or National
   Christian Foundation) charitable gift annuity program.  All charitable
   gift annuities will then fall under the policies and procedures of
   community foundation’s program.

6. Charitable Remainder Trusts.  IFI may accept designation as remainder
   beneficiary of a charitable remainder trust.  IFI will not accept
   appointment as Trustee of a charitable remainder trust.

7. Charitable Lead Trusts.  IFI may accept a designation as income
   beneficiary of a charitable lead trust.  IFI will not accept appointment
   as Trustee of a charitable lead trust. 


##### Section 2.5 Unacceptable Gifts.  

IFI will not accept any of the following gifts: 

 

1. Gifts made with intent to discriminate that restrict use based upon age,
   race, color, religion, creed, nationality, political affiliation, gender
   or sexual orientation. 

2. Gifts with restrictions regarding the employment of any person. 

3. Gifts which restrict use of the gift to programs or collections that are
   not part of IFI’s mission, without prior approval of IFI’s Board of
   Directors. 

4. Gifts that provide financial benefits to any individual or organization
   besides IFI. 

5. Gifts in which IFI assumes indebtedness in connection with the gift.
   Exceptions to the contrary must be approved by IFI’s Board of Directors. 

6. Gifts in which IFI would be exposed to material or personal liabilities
   as owners of the property.  

7. Gifts in which IFI would be exposed to any adverse publicity.    

8. Gifts which require IFI to name any facility or to procure the naming of
   a facility or portion of a facility, without prior approval of the IFI
   Board of Directors.


##### Section 2.5 Endowment Giving.   

1. Unrestricted endowment.  Gifts, not designated for other specific
   purposes, shall be added to an IFI Unrestricted Endowment; income and
   other returns from which shall cover IFI operations and periodic
   distributions to IFI for
   programs and services, capital improvements, and special projects. 

2. Named Funds.  Named Funds (donations at or exceeding $15,000) may be
   established by donors within IFI’s funds.  All named funds shall be
   created by a written gift agreement.  The written agreement should
   include language to permit IFI to assign an
   alternative, related use of such funds if it becomes necessary, i.e. due
   to the elimination of a program supported by the fund.

    1. Any other gifts made to a named fund by any donor will be subject to
       the provisions of the fund.

    2. If the Named Fund is not fully funded by the donor, IFI
       has the discretion (subject to the terms of the gift
       agreement) to shift the funds to IFI’s Unrestricted Endowment,
       effectively dissolving the named fund.


##### Section 2.6 Disposition of Gifts.  

IFI’s Gift Review Committee will determine if the best interests of IFI is
served by the immediate liquidation of a gift into cash or if a gift not be
liquidated immediately and instead be held by IFI for such a period as the
Committee determines. 


##### Section 2.7 Use of Legal and Outside Counsel.  

The Board of Directors may engage legal counsel to advise IFI on any
proposed gift transaction.  In particular, the Board of Directors should
consider the use of counsel in the following circumstances:  (i) review of
gifts of closely held business interests, (ii) review of gifts of real
property, (ii) review of transactions governed by contracts or legal
documents, such as bargain sales or other documents requiring IFI to assume
an obligation, (iv) review of gifts which may involve potential conflicts
of interests, (v) review of documents naming IFI as Trustee, and (vi) any
other circumstances in which the Gift Review Committee believes that use of
counsel is appropriate.  


#### ARTICLE III Stewardship of Gifts 


##### Section 3.1  Ethical Stewardship.  

IFI’s Board of Directors will practice ethical stewardship of donated
funds, goods and services and honor donor requests for special
consideration and restriction of funds within the guidelines of these
policies.  If the Board of Directors is unable to honor a donor’s request,
the gift will be declined. 


##### Section 3.2  Responsibility for IRS Filings upon Sale of Gift Items.  

The Chief Financial Officer (CFO)  of IFI or his or her designee is
responsible for filing IRS Form 8282 (or any successor or additional forms
required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) upon the sale or
disposition of any asset sold within two years of receipt by IFI (or other
time specified by law) when the charitable deduction value of the item is
more than $5,000.  IFI or its designee must file this form within 125 days
of the date of sale or disposition of the asset (or other time specified by
law). 


##### Section 3.3  Responsibility to Donors.  

IFI will urge all prospective donors to seek the assistance of personal
legal and financial advisors in matters related to their gifts and the
resulting tax and estate planning consequences.  IFI will adhere to the
Association of Fundraising Professionals "Donor Bill of Rights" ([PDF](http://www.afpnet.org/files/ContentDocuments/YIPCareers_DonorBill.pdf){:target="_blank"})
and will also comply with its internal conflict of interest policy.
In addition, IFI will exercise the following responsibilities to donors:

   the donor.  

2. IFI will not accept a gift that does not aid in the advancement of IFI’s
   mission. 

3. IFI will not, under any circumstances, provide property appraisals or
   valuations to donors for tax purposes. 

4. IFI shall encourage donors to seek independent professional counsel
   prior to making a gift. 

5. IFI shall encourage donors to provide a Letter of Intent that sets forth
   the instructions of the donor regarding future administration of the
   donor’s gift.  The Letter of Intent can be modified and revised at any
   time at the request and instruction of the donor.  Upon receipt of the
   gift, IFI will exercise due diligence to carry out the instructions and
   intent of the donor.  In the event that this is not feasible or
   practical and an alternative purpose is not set forth in the Letter of
   Intent, IFI will exercise its variance power and seek to administer the
   gift in a manner similar to the donor’s instruction or where needed
   most. 

6. IFI will keep confidential all information obtained about prospective
   donors and specific gift arrangements regardless of whether or not a
   gift is made.  IFI may use selected information for purposes of

   with the prior permission of the donors.

   to claim a charitable income, gift or estate tax deduction.
