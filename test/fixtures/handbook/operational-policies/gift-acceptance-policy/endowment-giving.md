### Section 2.5 Endowment Giving.   

1. Unrestricted endowment.  Gifts, not designated for other specific
   purposes, shall be added to an IFI Unrestricted Endowment; income and
   other returns from which shall cover IFI operations and periodic
   distributions to IFI for
   programs and services, capital improvements, and special projects. 

2. Named Funds.  Named Funds (donations at or exceeding $15,000) may be
   established by donors within IFI’s funds.  All named funds shall be
   created by a written gift agreement.  The written agreement should
   include language to permit IFI to assign an
   alternative, related use of such funds if it becomes necessary, i.e. due
   to the elimination of a program supported by the fund.

    1. Any other gifts made to a named fund by any donor will be subject to
       the provisions of the fund.

    2. If the Named Fund is not fully funded by the donor, IFI
       has the discretion (subject to the terms of the gift
       agreement) to shift the funds to IFI’s Unrestricted Endowment,
       effectively dissolving the named fund.
