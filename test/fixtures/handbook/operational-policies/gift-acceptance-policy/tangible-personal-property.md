### Section 2.2. Tangible Personal Property.  

IFI may accept gifts of tangible personal property after considering the
marketability of such property, the costs of owning and maintaining the
property, any restrictions on the use of the property and whether the
property is directly related to IFI’s mission.  IFI’s acceptance of
tangible personal property does not guarantee its retention as IFI property
in perpetuity.
