### Section 3.3  Responsibility to Donors.  

IFI will urge all prospective donors to seek the assistance of personal
legal and financial advisors in matters related to their gifts and the
resulting tax and estate planning consequences.  IFI will adhere to the
Association of Fundraising Professionals "Donor Bill of Rights" ([PDF](http://www.afpnet.org/files/ContentDocuments/YIPCareers_DonorBill.pdf){:target="_blank"})
and will also comply with its internal conflict of interest policy.
In addition, IFI will exercise the following responsibilities to donors: 

 

1. IFI will not knowingly accept a gift that is not in the best interest of
   the donor.  

2. IFI will not accept a gift that does not aid in the advancement of IFI’s
   mission. 

3. IFI will not, under any circumstances, provide property appraisals or
   valuations to donors for tax purposes. 

4. IFI shall encourage donors to seek independent professional counsel
   prior to making a gift. 

5. IFI shall encourage donors to provide a Letter of Intent that sets forth
   the instructions of the donor regarding future administration of the
   donor’s gift.  The Letter of Intent can be modified and revised at any
   time at the request and instruction of the donor.  Upon receipt of the
   gift, IFI will exercise due diligence to carry out the instructions and
   intent of the donor.  In the event that this is not feasible or
   practical and an alternative purpose is not set forth in the Letter of
   Intent, IFI will exercise its variance power and seek to administer the
   gift in a manner similar to the donor’s instruction or where needed
   most. 

6. IFI will keep confidential all information obtained about prospective
   donors and specific gift arrangements regardless of whether or not a
   gift is made.  IFI may use selected information for purposes of
   referral, testimonial or example if a donor grants permission.  

7. Public announcements of gifts and/or intent to give may be made only
   with the prior permission of the donors. 

8. IFI will provide donors with the substantiation necessary for the donor
   to claim a charitable income, gift or estate tax deduction.
