### Section 2.4 Other Gifts.  

Other gifts may be accepted by IFI upon the approval of the Gift Review
Committee.  In determining whether to accept a gift, the Gift Review Committee 
shall consider the factors outlined below and, ultimately, whether acceptance 
of the gift is in the best interests of IFI. 
 

1. Closely Held Business Interests.  IFI may accept gifts of closely held
   business interests after considering the marketability of such property,
   liability risks associated with such interests, potential adverse tax
   consequences to IFI and any restrictions on the transfer of interests.

2. Real Property.  Normally, it will be the goal of IFI to sell any
   contributed real estate for its full fair market value as soon as
   possible after receipt.  Therefore, each proposed gift of real estate
   will be reviewed by legal or outside counsel partly to determine the
   conditions under which it can be sold.  However, IFI may receive real
   estate with the view to hold and use it directly in the IFI operations
   or otherwise to carry-out the organization’s exempt purposes.  Because
   of the time and resources involved in reviewing any gift of real estate,
   IFI prefers that any proposed gift of real estate involve $100,000 or
   more of equity. The following guidelines will be used in the review of
   gifts of real estate.  IFI requests that:

    1. The donor will provide the location, or a plot map, of the property
       so that a visual inspection of the site can be made.  

    2. The donor will provide copies of all leases, mortgages and other
       contracts affecting the property.  

    3. The Gift Review Committee will determine if it is advisable to obtain
       an Environmental Assessment so that IFI can be assured that the
       property is free of contamination and environmental hazards.  The
       donor will contract and pay for a Phase I Environmental Assessment
       of the property if the Gift Review Committee requests an assessment.
       If the Phase I Environmental Assessment indicates that environmental
       problems exist, an additional assessment or remediation may be
       required.  

    4. The tax law requires that the donor obtain a "qualified appraisal"
       of the property in order to claim a charitable income tax deduction
       on the donor's tax return for the year of the gift.  The very
       specific requirements for a qualified appraisal can be found in the
       IRS regulations, or in IRS Publication 561, Determining the Value of
       Donated Property.  The donor, IFI, and the appraiser all must sign
       the IRS Form 8283, which must be filed with the donor’s tax return.  

    5. The donor will provide evidence of clear title to the property
       through a title insurance policy.  

    6. The donor may need to sign an Indemnity Agreement to provide
       protection for IFI’s other assets.  The need for this agreement
       arises from the fact that there may be expenses that will require a
       cash outlay on the part of IFI between the time the property is
       contributed and eventually sold, and a donor’s fund might not have
       enough liquid assets to allow IFI to cover these expenses.  These
       expenses could include such items as taxes, insurance, maintenance,
       condominium charges, etc.  In some instances, IFI may agree to use
       the proceeds from the sale of the property to cover IFI’s expenses
       with respect to the property.  

    7. The donor will sign a recordable General Warranty Deed conveying the
       property to IFI.  The donor may also be asked to provide an
       Exemption from Real Property Conveyance Fee Form, so that the
       Warranty Deed can be filed with the Auditor’s Office and Recorder’s
       Office of the county in which the property is located. 

3. Life Insurance.  IFI may accept gifts of life insurance policies.  There
   are many methods by which life insurance may be donated to IFI and each
   method requires a thorough evaluation of the policy, insurance company
   and benefits to IFI.  IFI generally will accept donations of paid-up
   policies.  IFI may accept gifts of life insurance that require IFI to
   pay the premium if the donor pledges to continue paying premiums or
   gives IFI permission to surrender the policy for cash value.  IFI shall
   not accept gifts of life insurance where (i) there is a prearranged
   obligation for IFI to expend its assets to maintain the policy, (ii) any
   portion of the proceeds is paid to anyone or any organization that is
   not an organization described in Internal Revenue Code Section
   501(c)(3), or (iii) the policy is a split dollar or reverse split dollar
   plan.  All policies contributed to IFI must name IFI as the owner and
   irrevocable beneficiary of the policy.

4. Retirement Plans.  IFI may accept gifts from retirement plans which
   includes, but is not limited to, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs),
   401(k) and 403(b) plans, or other qualified or nonqualified plans.
   Before accepting the gift, IFI will require a thorough evaluation of the
   retirement plan.  All retirements plans contributed to IFI must name IFI
   as the primary, successor or contingent beneficiary for all or a
   percentage of the assets upon the death of the donor as owner or upon
   death of the owner’s spouse, if applicable.  Such beneficiary
   designation must be on the form prescribed by the trustee or
   administrator of the retirement account and properly filed with the
   same.

5. Charitable Gift Annuities.  IFI may offer charitable gift annuities to
   qualified donors.  As a general rule, IFI will utilize the services of a
   community foundation’s (such as The Columbus Foundation or National
   Christian Foundation) charitable gift annuity program.  All charitable
   gift annuities will then fall under the policies and procedures of
   community foundation’s program.

6. Charitable Remainder Trusts.  IFI may accept designation as remainder
   beneficiary of a charitable remainder trust.  IFI will not accept
   appointment as Trustee of a charitable remainder trust.

7. Charitable Lead Trusts.  IFI may accept a designation as income
   beneficiary of a charitable lead trust.  IFI will not accept appointment
   as Trustee of a charitable lead trust.
