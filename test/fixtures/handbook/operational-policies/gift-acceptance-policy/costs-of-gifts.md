### Section 1.3 Costs of Gifts.  

IFI will not accept gifts that may result in expenses and or fees that will
be incurred by IFI.  However, IFI will clarify with a donor under what
circumstances, if any, IFI will pay for legal fees or professional fees
with respect to completing a gift.  IFI may also choose to pay for
appraisals for its own purposes.  If IFI pays for a gift cost that is the
legal obligation of the donor, the value of the gift will be reduced by the
cost to IFI for the services, or alternatively, the gift may be treated as
a bargain sale for tax purposes with the cost to IFI as the compensation to
the donor.
